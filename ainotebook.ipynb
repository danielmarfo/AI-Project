      "The eye as a physical receptor\n",
      "Rods are highly sensitive to light and therefore allow us to see under a low level of illumination\n",

      "Cones are the second type of receptor in the eye. They are less sensitive to light than the rods and can therefore tolerate more light. \n",

      "1. Perceiving size and depth\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does the eye perceive size, depth and relative distances? To understand this, we must consider how the image appears on the retina. \n",
      "\n",
      "reflected light from the object forms an upside-down image on the retina.\n",
      "\n",
      "The size of that image is specified as a visual angle.\n",

      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Visual angle\n",
      "If we were to draw a line from the top of the object to a central point on the front of the eye and a second line from the bottom of the object to the same point, the visual angle of the object is the angle between these two lines. \n",
      "Visual angle is affected by both:\n",
      " the size of the object\n",
      " and its distance from the eye. \n",

      "Visual angle\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore if two objects are at the same distance, the larger one will have the larger visual angle. \n",

      "Similarly, if two objects of the same size are placed at different distances from the eye, the furthest one will have the smaller visual angle. Why?\n",

      "Visual Angle and Perception of size\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, our perception of an object’s size remains constant even if its visual angle changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "E.g: So a person’s height is perceived as constant even if they move further from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the law of size constancy, and it indicates that our perception of size relies on factors other than the visual angle.\n",
      " One of these factors is our perception of depth.\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "2. Perception of Brightness\n",
      "The second aspect of visual perception is the perception of brightness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brightness is in fact a subjective reaction to levels of light. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is affected by luminance which is the amount of light emitted by an object. \n",
      "\n",
      "The luminance of an object is dependent on the amount of light falling on the object’s surface and its reflective properties\n",

      "3. Perceiving color\n",
      "The third factor that we need to consider is perception of color.\n",

      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "3. Perceiving color\n",
      "Hue is just another word for color. Simply put: Each position around the color wheel represents a different hue.\n",
      "Hue is determined by the spectral wavelength of the light. \n",
      "Blues have short wavelengths, \n",
      "greens medium \n",
      "and reds long. \n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately 150 different hues can be discriminated by the average person.\n",

      "Perceiving color\n",
      "\n",
      " Intensity is the brightness of the color, and\n",
      "\n",
      "saturation is the amount of whiteness in the color. \n",
      "\n",
      "By varying these two (intensity and saturation), we can perceive in the region of 7 million different colours. \n",

      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Perceiving color\n",
      "The eye perceives color because the cones are sensitive to light of different wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three different types of cone, each sensitive to a different color (blue, green and red).\n",

      "Optical Illusion\n",

      "In fact, the two lines are the same length. \n",
      "This may be due to a false application of the law of size constancy\n",
      " the top line appears like a concave edge, the bottom like a convex edge. The former therefore seems further away than the latter and is therefore scaled to appear larger.\n",
      " A similar illusion is the Ponzo illusion (Figure 5).  Here the top line appears longer, owing to the distance effect although both lines are the same length. \n",
      "These illusions demonstrate that our perception of size is not completely reliable.\n",

      "Fitts’ law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes\n",

      "Fitts’ Law and HCI\n",
      "Fitts’ law is widely applied in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design.\n",
      " For example, this law influenced the convention of making interactive buttons large (especially on finger-operated mobile devices)\n",
      "—smaller buttons are more difficult (and time-consuming) to click. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, the distance between a user’s task/attention area and the task-related button should be kept as short as possible.\n",

      "Fitts’ Law and HCI\n",
      "There are many variations of the Fitts’ law formula, which have varying constants, but they are all very similar.\n",
      "One common form is\n",
      "Movement time = a + b log2(distance/size + 1)\n",
      "where a and b are empirically determined constants.\n",
      "\n",
      "This affects the type of target we design. Since users will find it more difficult to manipulate small objects, targets should generally be as large as possible and the distance to be moved as small as possible.\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Human factors in HCI\n",
      "humans have similar capabilities and limitations and that we can therefore make generalizations. To an extent this is true\n",
      "\n",
      "Notwithstanding this, we should remember that, although we share processes in common, humans, and therefore users, are not all the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should be aware of individual differences so that we can account for them as far as possible within our designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Human factors in HCI\n",
      "\n",
      "These differences may be long term, such as sex, physical capabilities and intellectual capabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Others are shorter term and include the effect of stress or fatigue on the user. Still others change through time, such as age.\n",

      " It is useful to consider, for any design decision, if there are likely to be users within the target group who will be adversely affected by our decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the extremes, a decision may exclude a section of the user population. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the current emphasis on visual interfaces excludes those who are visually impaired, unless the design also makes use of the other sensory channels\n",

      "How many can you remember? Then try to describe the image/graphic of the latest app you downloaded.\n",
      "Comment\n",
      "It is likely that you remembered the image, the colors, and the name of the app you downloaded much better than the birthdays of your family and friends—most people now rely on\n",
      "Facebook or other online app to remind them about such special dates. \n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Memory\n",
      "People are good at remembering visual cues about things, for example, the color of items, the location of objects (for example, a book being on the top shelf), and marks on an object (like a scratch on a watch, a chip on a cup, and so on). \n",
      "In contrast, people find other kinds of information persistently difficult to learn and remember, especially arbitrary material like phone numbers.\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Memory Load and Passwords\n",
      "Phone, online, and mobile banking allow customers to carry out financial transactions, such as paying bills and checking the balance of their accounts, at their convenience. \n",
      "One of the problems confronting banks that provide these capabilities, however, is how to manage security concerns, especially preventing fraudulent transactions.\n",
      "One solution has been to develop rigorous security measures whereby customers must provide multiple pieces of information before gaining access to their accounts. \n",
      "This is called multifactor authentication (MFA). \n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Memory loads and Passwords\n",
      "The method requires a user to provide two or more pieces of evidence that only they know, such as the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Their ZIP code or postal code\n",
      "• Their mother’s maiden name\n",
      "• Their birthplace\n",
      "• The last school they attended\n",

      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Memory loads and Passwords\n",
      "This requirement to remember and recall such information puts a big memory load on customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people find such a procedure quite nerve-racking and are prone to forget certain pieces of information.\n",
      "\n",
      " As a coping strategy, they write down their details on a sheet of paper.\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Memory loads and Passwords\n",
      "Having such an external representation at hand makes it much easier for them to read off the necessary information rather than having to recall it from memory. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it also makes them vulnerable to the fraud the banks are trying to prevent should anyone else get ahold of that piece of paper! \n",
      "\n",
      "Software companies have also developed password managers to help reduce memory load. \n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How can banks overcome the problem of providing a secure system while making the memory load easier for people wanting to use online and mobile phone banking?\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Comments\n",
      "Advances in computer vision and biometrics technology means that it is now possible to replace the need for passwords to be typed in each time.\n",
      "\n",
      " For example, facial and touch ID can be configured on newer smartphones to enable password-free mobile banking. \n",
      "Once these are set up, a user simply needs to put their face in front of their phone’s camera or their finger on the fingerprint sensor. \n",
      "These alternative approaches put the onus on the phone to recognize and authenticate the person rather than the person having to learn and remember a password.\n",
      "Slides based on Human-Computer Interaction 3rd Edition by by Alan Dix, Janet E. Finlay, Gregory D. Abowd, Russell Beale\n",
      "Memory: Design Implications\n",
      "• Reduce cognitive load by avoiding long and complicated procedures for carrying out tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall by using familiar interaction patterns, menus, icons, and consistently placed objects.\n",

      "A user is an individual user or a group of users working together. \n",
      "It is important to appreciate the way people's sensory systems (sight, hearing, \n",
      "touch) relay information. \n",
      "Also, different users form different conceptions or mental models about their \n",
